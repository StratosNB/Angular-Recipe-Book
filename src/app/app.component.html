<!-- Navigation:
  
     The parent component will listen the featureSelected event,
     which will trigger the onNavigate($event) event.
     The $event means that the parameter will be the parameter that the featureSelected event
     has passed tho this component which can be recipe or shopping-list.
     The method onNavigate will set the current loadedFeature() which can be one of the 2 already
     mentioned.
     Using the structural directive *ngIf, we can show only the component we have selected/clicked -->
<app-header (featureSelected)="onNavigate($event)"></app-header>
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <app-recipes *ngIf="loadedFeature === 'recipe'"></app-recipes>
      <app-shopping-list *ngIf="loadedFeature !== 'recipe'"></app-shopping-list>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
